An Image Encryption Algorthim Using genetic Algorithm and Bit Slice and Rotation. Here We make use of the main feature of the Genetic Algorithm, crossover and mutation. Genetic Algorithm Acts as the main Encryption Algorithm.To increase the randomness and the security the bits(pixels) are sliced  in to 8  parst and then rotated  270 ,180 and 90.



Algorthim:
1. Read the image.
Encryption:
1. Apply crossover and mutation.
2. Apply Bitslice and rotation
Decryption:
1. Reverse the rotated bits 
2. Apply Genetic Algorithm.
